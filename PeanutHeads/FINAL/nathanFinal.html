        <h1>All About Me!</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Hello there! My name is Nathan Her! I'm currently 16 and i've been learning about HTML and CSS code! I've also been asked a couple questions!</p>
        <br>
        <h1>What part of IT are you interested in, and what motivates you in reaching those
        interests?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>When I joined this program, I wasn't really interested in the IT field but now that I've spent over two months researching about it. I've learned how much coding is involved with almost every field imaginable. I think the part I take most interest in is definitely designing a website. A big motivator for me is that I get to make a website look good! </p>
        <br>
        <h1>What about this internship motivates you more?</h1>
        <p>This internship has really sparked a fire to learn more about coding. Being able to understand the process and code behind a website makes me feel both super smart and confident in my skills! </p>
        <br>
        <h1>Based on your internship, what would you like to learn next?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>After this internship I definitely want to dig into Javascript! Just imagining the ways I could expand my coding skills gets me excited!</p>
